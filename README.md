## Privacy and Authentication 

![Banner8](https://i.ibb.co/wrQG6YdN/1000039764-Photoroom.png)


In DocuWrite Pro, we highly value your privacy. As a client side service, we don't connect or share your data with any external servers. In rare occasions we do let you know through your dashboard. 

<details>
<summary><strong>Forms of Authentication</strong></summary>

- **Account Creation:**  
  On the web version of DocuWrite Pro, you need to create an account on the Dashboard page. Your data is stored locally on your device. We use your **Name** and **Profile Picture** to enhance your experience within DocuWrite Pro tools. This data is **not shared with third-party services**. You can manually clear your browser cookies to remove this data.

- **Human Verification:**  
  On the web version of DocuWrite Pro, you also verify that you are human using a simple test. This service is provided by **MCaptcha**, a sub-division of DocuWrite Pro. MCaptcha helps keep our platform free from invaders and automated bots.

## Use of AI

![Banner9](https://i.ibb.co/3Z784cQ/1000040372-Photoroom.png)

ⓘ DocuWrite Pro avoids built-in AI (Artificial Intelligence) to protect user privacy and security. As a fully client-side document editor, all data stays on the user’s device, ensuring full control, transparency, and trust.

<details>
<summary><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence in DocuWrite Pro</strong></summary>

- <strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence during development:</strong><br>
  During the development of DocuWrite Pro, we took guidance and inspiration from various AI models. This does not imply direct copying of code. Instead, AI tools were used for design inspiration, debugging assistance, general suggestions, and feedback analysis. Additionally, GitHub Copilot’s “Auto Generate” feature is used to create clear and structured commit messages during version control.

- <strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence within DocuWrite Pro:</strong><br>
  DocuWrite Pro is a fully self-hosted, independent project with no commercial partnerships or revenue sources. To keep the platform free and accessible, it relies entirely on GitHub’s hosting infrastructure. Due to these constraints—and because AI-generated outputs can sometimes be inaccurate or unreliable—DocuWrite Pro intentionally does not integrate Artificial Intelligence into its core features or functionality.
