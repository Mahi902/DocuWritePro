      <h1 id="main-title">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <div class="muted">Last Updated: September 12, 2025</div>

      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>DocuWrite Pro</strong> (the "Service", "we", "us" or "our") treats information when you access or use our website hosted on Google Sites. DocuWrite Pro is intentionally designed to minimize user data collection. The purpose of this document is to describe clearly and transparently what (if any) information is processed and how — so that visitors can use the Service with confidence.</p>

      <h2>1. Key summary</h2>
      <p>Short version: DocuWrite Pro is a free, no‑account, no‑login website hosted on Google Sites. We do not collect, store, or share personal data. We do not process payments, do not use third‑party analytics, and do not set tracking or advertising cookies. Any technical cookies that may be present are a function of Google Sites and are not controlled by DocuWrite Pro.</p>

      <h2>2. No account, no sign‑up, no personal data collection</h2>
      <p>DocuWrite Pro does not provide user accounts, registration, or login functionality. We do not ask for or store names, email addresses, phone numbers, postal addresses, or any other personally identifiable information (PII). Because the Service is 100% free with no upgrade or paid tiers, we never request or process credit card or billing information.</p>

      <h2>3. Cookies and tracking</h2>
      <p>DocuWrite Pro itself does not set cookies for analytics, advertising, or user profiling. However, the site is hosted on <strong>Google Sites</strong> and Google may set technical cookies as part of its hosting, content delivery, or security infrastructure. These cookies are controlled by Google and not by DocuWrite Pro. We do not embed Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or other tracking/advertising scripts in the site.</p>
      <p class="small">If you wish to inspect cookies set by Google Sites for this domain, please use your browser's developer tools. For Google's cookie and privacy practices see Google's privacy documentation.</p>

      <h2>4. Content you enter while using the Service</h2>
      <p>The Service provides editors and tools where you can type or paste text. Because DocuWrite Pro does not store session data, information entered into a page's text fields or editors exists only in your browser session. Unless you copy, download, or otherwise export that content yourself, it will not be captured by DocuWrite Pro servers. In practical terms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Text you type is kept locally in your browser memory while the page is open.</li>
        <li>Closing or refreshing the page typically clears that local content, unless your browser or an extension explicitly preserves form state.</li>
        <li>We do not retain or archive any user-entered content on our servers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Voluntary submissions and contact</h2>
      <p>If you voluntarily send feedback, bug reports, or other messages using external email addresses or contact forms that route through third‑party mail services, that message content may be processed by the receiving email service. DocuWrite Pro does not centrally store these messages beyond what your chosen email provider retains. If you plan to send sensitive personal information, please avoid including such data in feedback messages.</p>

      <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
      <p>Because DocuWrite Pro does not collect or store personal data by design, there is no customer data retention policy for user‑provided personal data. Any content you type in your browser remains under your control. There are no backups, logs, or archives maintained by DocuWrite Pro that contain user-generated text or PII.</p>

      <h2>7. Children and minors</h2>
      <p>DocuWrite Pro does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the local age of digital consent). Because no data collection or registration exists, the Service can be used by pupils and minors under supervision. If a parent or guardian believes personal data associated with a child was inadvertently collected, contact us (see "Contact" section) and we will explain the situation and take reasonable steps if applicable.</p>

      <h2>8. Security</h2>
      <p>We adopt a minimal-risk approach by not collecting personal data. Still, we rely on the secure hosting and transport provided by Google Sites and standard HTTPS/TLS encryption for all connections. Although no personal data is stored, you should still practice caution when using public or shared devices. Keep your local browser and operating system up to date.</p>

      <h2>9. Third-party services</h2>
      <p>DocuWrite Pro is hosted on Google Sites. Google is a separate data controller or processor with its own policies and controls. Any information or cookies set by Google are governed by Google's policies, not this Privacy Policy. Links, embedded content, or features that redirect to third‑party services have their own privacy terms. We do not embed advertising or third‑party analytics services into the site by default.</p>

      <h2>10. International visitors and compliance</h2>
      <p>DocuWrite Pro is accessible globally. Because we do not collect personal data, many data protection obligations under laws such as the GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), LGPD (Brazil), PDPA (Singapore/Malaysia), and similar privacy regimes are not triggered. However, we strive to be transparent and to honor users' rights where applicable. If you have a jurisdiction-specific request, you may contact us (see "Contact" below).</p>

      <h2>11. Your rights</h2>
      <p>Because DocuWrite Pro does not process personal data, the standard rights related to access, correction, portability, deletion and objection generally do not apply — there is no personal data to act upon. If you believe we may have inadvertently collected information about you via third-party channels (for example, an email you sent that included PII), please contact us and we will work to address your concern.</p>

      <h2>12. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy from time to time to reflect changes in the Service, hosting environment or legal obligations. If material changes occur, the updated policy will include a revised "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of those changes.</p>

      <h2>13. Contact information</h2>
      <p>If you have questions, complaints, or requests about privacy at DocuWrite Pro, contact us through the website's Contact page or via the official site email address (if published). For site‑specific contact use: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/docuwritepro/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact — DocuWrite Pro</a>.</p>

      <h2>14. Additional clarifications and illustrative examples</h2>
      <p>The following items are included to provide clarity on scenarios users frequently ask about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Search Engine Indexing:</strong> Public pages may be indexed by search engines. Indexing is controlled by the search engine and by Google Sites settings; DocuWrite Pro does not manually submit content to search indexes.</li>
        <li><strong>Embedded Content:</strong> If you visit a page that embeds content from another site (for example, a video or map), that third party may collect technical information; review the third party's privacy policy before interacting with that content.</li>
        <li><strong>Browser Extensions and Local Storage:</strong> Browser extensions you install can access page content and may save data locally. This is outside DocuWrite Pro's control. We recommend using trusted extensions and reviewing their permissions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>15. Legal bases and governance</h2>
      <p>Where applicable under data protection law, DocuWrite Pro's limited processing (for example, handling a contact email you voluntarily send) will be carried out on lawful grounds such as legitimate interest or consent where required. Because the Service is designed to avoid data collection, robust governance procedures relating to personal data processing are not required in most scenarios.</p>

      <h2>16. Accountability and transparency</h2>
      <p>We operate using the principle of data minimization: only collect what is necessary — and in our case, <em>collect nothing</em>. This approach reduces risk for users and simplifies compliance. We welcome questions and will respond promptly where practicable.</p>

      <h2>17. Example statements you can rely on</h2>
      <p>If you need a one-line statement for other documentation or sharing with others, you may use one of the following:</p>
      <pre>• "DocuWrite Pro does not collect, store, or sell personal data; it is hosted on Google Sites and provides free, anonymous access to document tools."</pre>

      <h2>18. A note on availability and reliability</h2>
      <p>DocuWrite Pro is hosted on Google Sites and relies on Google's infrastructure for uptime and delivery. We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability and are not liable for outages, interruptions, or changes in Google Sites' policies that affect the Service.</p>

      <h2>19. Contact & enforcement</h2>
      <p>For privacy questions or to report concerns, use the site's Contact page: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/docuwritepro/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact — DocuWrite Pro</a>. For residents in jurisdictions with data protection authorities, you may raise concerns with the relevant regulator if you believe your rights are not being respected.</p>

      <p class="footer-note">This Privacy Policy is intended to be comprehensive yet readable. It is not legal advice. If you require a formal legal review for compliance with local laws or specialized use cases, consult a qualified attorney.</p>
